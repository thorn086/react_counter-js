# React counter

> Here is [the working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_counter/)

## Description

You are given an application with a counter and three buttons.
Your task is to implement the logic for updating the counter.

---

## Buttons behavior

### Add 1

* Calls `addOne`
* Increases the counter by 1

---

### Add 100

* Calls `add100`
* Increases the counter by 100

---

### Increase

* `Increase` button first checks the current `count` value:
    * if the current value is divisible by `5`, it first calls `add100`;
    * after that, it always calls `addOne`.
---

## Initial state

```
Count: 0
```
